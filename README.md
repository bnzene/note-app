# Notes app

The product of a week's crash course in further JavaScript. The brief is to write a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript.

Concepts tackled include:
* Frontend, single page web apps.
* Events and event handlers.
* Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).
* Ajax.
* Frontend templating.
* Frontend routing.

## Getting Started


### Installing

You'll need to have npm installed to manage dependencies. Run ```npm install``` to ensure you have all the necessary packages.

To run the app, go into the root directory of note-app and run ```open index.html```.

## Running the tests

* To run the tests, open index.html, ideally in Chrome. Open the Console with Cmd+Alt+I to see what's going on.
* As the app is structured as a series of nested models, the tests for each model function as unit tests.

## Built With

* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - The web framework used
* [Ajax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX) - Client-server interaction
